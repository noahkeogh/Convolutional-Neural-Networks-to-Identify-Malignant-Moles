## About the Project 
This project investigates several different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures 
and adapts them to the task of malignant (cancerous) mole identification. Melanoma skin cancers have a 5-year survival rate of nearly 99% when detected and treated early. Around 30\% of existing moles arise from malignant moles. Though these malignant moles can be idenitfied and removed by dermatologists they are generally difficult for an untrained professional to distinguish a malginant mole from a benign mole. Thus, early detection of malignant moles often relies on regular visits to a dermatologist. 

This project aims to adapt CNN to the task of identifying malignant moles. The trained CNNs may improve the ability of people to detect malignant moles early by providing them with a method of identifying malignant moles from home. 


## Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is publicly-available from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images). The dataset consists of 10,605 dermoscopy images. 5,105 images are of malignant moles and the remaining 5,500 images are of benign moles.
